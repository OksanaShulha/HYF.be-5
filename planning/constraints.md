# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

We have only 2 weeks for the project. Deadline is on Sunday, 21 of February.
We don't have the original code in repository and we have to take out the code using developer tool.
The website we have to build is quite big and complex.

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

Some people have not more than 3 hours per day for coding so tasks will be distributed considering individual schedules.

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Using developer tools** to check the original code of the website.
- **Skipping** some sections of the website that are unnesassary is ok. No Java-script due to lack of knowledge.
- **One approval** is enough for pull request too speed up the workflow, because there are not always people available for rewieving.
- We will try to create the whole website but if there is not enough time, we will only make **Must-have pages**.

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
-->
