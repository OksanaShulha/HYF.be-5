# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

Our Project Board is similar to our Development Strategy. Everything that we planed wasn't done but we've added a few new issues and sections.

## Stop Doing

<!--
  what did your group do that did not go very well
  agree to stop doing this in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - pushing changes directly to master/main branch
  - claiming more issues at once than you can finish
-->

- Never ever give similar names for different branches)) 

## Continue Doing

<!--
  what did your group that worked well
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->

- We had regular communication about our project and we are agree to keep doing this.
- Helping each other.
